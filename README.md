# GET MY NEWS - BACKEND

Our backend is powered by **ExpressJS**, ensuring robust server-side logic and routing. We prioritize security by utilizing bcrypt to hash and securely store passwords in **MongoDB**. We seamlessly integrate with the **WorldNewAPI** to collect news data and offer features for users to modify their profile information securely.

## Features

- **Authentication System**: Securely stores user credentials in MongoDB, ensuring data integrity.
- **Integration with WorldNewAPI**: Collects real-time news data to provide personalized news updates.
- **User Profile Management**: Enables users to modify their profile information, including name, email, password, and profile picture.
